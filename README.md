# Smart-House-Security-System-Design-Using-C#-and-Arduino-.
The aim of the study is to design the basic security system, which can be used in smart homes, in a new approach which is prototypical and open to development. ATmega2560
microcontroller in Arduino Mega is programmed with Processing language. Software control of the system is done with a designed controlling software and C# has been used as
the programming language.

In the designed security system, eight components have been used(Ultrasonic Sensor(HC-SR501), Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11), 4x4 Matrix Membrane Keypad, LDR, DC Motor, L293D Motor Driver, Buzzer and Leds). The data coming from these sensors are processed owing to interaction controlling software â€“microcontroller. In case of emergency, a structure which can send e-mails to inform the administrators and users and take precautions, has also been built. All kind of entries related to the system can be display to the system user interface
